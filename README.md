# Insta Follower Bot

**Insta Follower Bot** is an automation script in python that follows a given Instagram profile.

## Prerequisites

- Python must be installed on your targets machine.

## Usage

1. Download the repository containing the `Insta_follower_bot.pyw` script and the `instagram_link.ini` configuration file.
2. Open the `instagram_link.ini` configuration file in a text editor and replace `https://www.instagram.com/YOUR_PROFILE` with the link to the Instagram profile you want your target to follow.
3. If your Instagram profile does not have a profile picture, open the `Insta_follower_bot.pyw` script in a text editor and set the `Profile_picture` variable to `False`.
4. (Optional) For advanced users: If you prefer not to use a configuration file, you can edit the `Insta_follower_bot.pyw` script directly and adjust the `INSTAGRAM_LINK` variable. Ensure to add a delay (`time.sleep(3)`) after `webbrowser.open(INSTAGRAM_LINK)`.
5. Run the script on the target's machine.
6. Profit.

## Unique Features
- The script will delete itself after execution, or in case of an error. 
- Our Deletion Bypass method leaves no trace of the script behind, not even in the Recycle Bin.
- Follow method variably, depending on the elements of the profile.
